        "Add a caption... What if the Bay of Bengal shaped Bangladesh's future economy? That's the mission behind 'Shark', a robot made by 15 students aged 13 to 23, competing at RoboSub 2025 in California. Built by the 'Tech Autocratsâ€“Bengal Sub' team, the robot can dodge underwater obstacles, identify objects, and map pollution zones. The team's goal? Build an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for real-world use: sea rescue, river pollution mapping, and even mineral detection. They're now prepping for a live test at St. Martin's Island. It's Bangladesh's first entry into RoboSub, where schools like MIT and Stanford compete. With support from the ICT Division and a dream bigger than the ocean, these students are showing what young minds can engineer, when given a deep enough dive.",
